    "- We will use some PDF files to ask AI the question: **\"Where are the main locations of puffin colonies?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "- PDF files about puffins were downloaded using the Langchain library. These files were loaded as documents with `PyPDFLoader` and then split using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, the Pinecone and OpenAI API keys were turned into environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using `OpenAIEmbeddings` and `PineconeVectorStore`, all document texts were converted into embedding vectors. These texts, along with their vectors, metadata, and generated UUIDs, were stored in the Pinecone cloud database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using `similarity_search` method, a question was converted to embedding values, and using cosine similarity, Pinecone found the top 10 (k=10) similar documents to that question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After assigning the top 10 similar documents as context for the `ChatOpenAI` class, questions were asked of the AI, and it provided answer.\n",

They are also found in colonies on Protection and Smith Islands in the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. In Oregon, puffin colonies are located at sites such as Haystack Rock, Three Arch Rocks, and Cape Meares. In California, puffin colonies are mainly found on the northern coast, including locations like Prince Island, Castle Rock, and Green Rock. Additionally, puffins breed in significant numbers in the Aleutian Islands and along the Alaskan Peninsula.\n"
